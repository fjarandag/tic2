<h3 id="song1">The Hounds Of Winter</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Mercury falling<br />
I rise from my bed,<br />
Collect my thoughts together<br />
I have to hold my head<br />
It seems that she's gone<br />
And somehow I am pinned by<br />
The Hounds of Winter<br />
Howling in the wind<br />
I walk through the day<br />
My coat around my ears<br />
I look for my companion<br />
I have to dry my tears<br />
It seems that she's gone<br />
Leaving me too soon<br />
I'm as dark as December<br />
I'm as cold as the Man in the Moon</p>
<p>I still see her face<br />
As beautiful as day<br />
It's easy to remember<br />
Remember my love that way<br />
All I hear is that lonesome sound<br />
The Hounds of Winter<br />
They follow me down</p>
<p>I can't make up the fire<br />
The way that she could<br />
I spend all my days<br />
In the search for dry wood<br />
Board all the windows and close the front door<br />
I can't believe she won't be here anymore</p>
<p>I still see her face<br />
As beautiful as day<br />
It's easy to remember<br />
Remember my love that way<br />
All I hear is that lonesome sound<br />
The Hounds of Winter<br />
They follow me down</p>
<p>A season for joy<br />
A season for sorrow<br />
Where she's gone<br />
I will surely, surely follow<br />
She brightened my day<br />
She warmed the coldest night<br />
The Hounds of Winter<br />
They got me in their sights</p>
<p>I still see her face<br />
As beautiful as day<br />
It's easy to remember<br />
Remember my love that way<br />
All I hear is that lonesome sound<br />
The Hounds of Winter<br />
They harry me down</p>

<h3 id="song2">Fragile</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If blood will flow when flesh and steel are one<br />
Drying in the colour of the evening sun<br />
Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away<br />
But something in our minds will always stay<br />
Perhaps this final act was meant<br />
To clinch a lifetime's argument<br />
That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could<br />
For all those born beneath an angry star<br />
Lest we forget how fragile we are</p>
<p>On and on the rain will fall<br />
Like tears from a star, like tears from a star<br />
On and on the rain will say<br />
How fragile we are, how fragile we are</p>
<p>On and on the rain will fall<br />
Like tears from a star, like tears from a star<br />
On and on the rain will say<br />
How fragile we are, how fragile we are<br />
How fragile we are, how fragile we are</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How like the fall<br />
To be gone in a day<br />
Just as the leaves had turned gold<br />
I was drawn to a sound<br />
That the wind carried down<br />
From an open window pane<br />
And oh, how like a song<br />
Or a sad melody<br />
To linger long after the end<br />
And the harmony rings<br />
With the promise of spring<br />
On a Brooklyn street</p>
<p>How like the fall to be gone in a day<br />
Just as the trees had turned gold<br />
I was drawn to this sound<br />
That some fingers had found<br />
But now the winter seems to stay too long<br />
How like a song<br />
Or a sad melody<br />
To linger long after it's gone<br />
Though the window is closed<br />
And the questions it posed<br />
On a Brooklyn street</p>
<p>How like the spring<br />
To return in a day<br />
When everything seems to be new<br />
But here's someone who's hoping<br />
The window is open<br />
On that Brooklyn street again<br />
And oh, how like a song<br />
Or a sweet melody<br />
To linger long after it's gone<br />
Let the harmony ring<br />
With the promise of spring<br />
On a Brooklyn street</p>
